### Texture mapping of scene and characters

![A snow-person is visible made up of 3 stacked spheres. The top sphere has a face made from lumps of coal, while the lower 2 spheres have a line of buttons made from coal. 2 stick arms are attached to either side of the middle sphere.](screenshots/texture_mapping.png)

### Implementation of Phong illumination model

![A closeup of a pink snow-person is visible. The specular highlight is visible in the middle, as well as  a broader diffuse lighting from an unseen light source. Even the parts of the snow-person that are not directly in line of sight to the light source are lit up as there is ambient lighting too.](screenshots/phong_illumination_model.png)

## Advanced Features

![A group of rolling greyish-white hills is visible in front of a grey sky.](screenshots/heightmap.png)

### Partial transparency using Alpha blending

![A snow-person is visible behind a partially transparent Christmas tree that is a solid cone.](screenshots/animated_crowd.png)

### Skybox (using cubemap)

![A group of snow-people are visible gathered around a Christmas tree in the bottom right of the image while above them is the grey sky with white clouds visible.](screenshots/skybox.png)

### Fog

![A crowd of snow-people stand around a simplified Christmas tree in the distance, their colours greyed by the fog. An orange light is visible beside them, which is not affected by the fog.](screenshots/fog.png)
